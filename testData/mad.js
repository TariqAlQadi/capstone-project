        "SUBSCRIBE: http://MADISON.yt/SUBSCRIBE\n\nTo follow on from, and to compliment my last video - DIAMONDS, here is an idea with PERFECT ACES, which I mentioned in the last video.  This trick allows you to apparently predict the positions of any number of cards in a deck thoroughly shuffled by the participant - and you can use this same method to also know the exact positions of all of the Aces in a shuffled deck.  Also, the deck give-away winner is announced in this video!
