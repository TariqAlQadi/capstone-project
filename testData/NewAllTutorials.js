This is a dealing technique known as \"sailing cards\" and allows you to deal cards long distances and with accuracy.\n\nIt's a useful card skill to learn if you enjoy playing card games and also if you're interested in learning false dealing techniques. If you want to be able to do second deals or bottoms deals, then often times you will do these deals while sailing the cards to someone sitting across the table from you in the context of a magic trick or gambling routine.\n\n▼ Deck Used \n-----------------------------------\nBlack Mint - http://52kards.com/Mint\nRaspberry Mint - http://52kards.com/Mint\n\n\n▼ Follow 52Kards Everywhere\n------------------------------------------\nWebsite: http://52Kards.com\nInstagram: http://Instagram.com/52Kards\nFacebook: http://on.fb.me/52Kards\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/52Kards",

Ironically, this is often achieved in the process of pretending to give the deck a fair shuffle. Before we learn these card controls and false shuffle techniques, we first need to learn how to do an actual real shuffle. One of the first shuffles you ought to learn is called the "Overhand Shuffle" as it is quite easy to do and very useful.\n\n🃏 Deck Used 🃏\n-----------------------------------\nMINT 2 - https:/Mint52.com\n\n🛠 MY EQUIPMENT 🛠\n-----------------------------------\nPlaying Cards - https://shop.52kards.com/collections/playing-cards\nMain Camera - https://amzn.to/3aYrSz6\nMain Lens - https://amzn.to/2Zgq0fy\nMicrophone - https://amzn.to/37cWwDM\nLighting - https://amzn.to/3qfJSvc\n\n👍 Follow 52Kards Everywhere 👍\n------------------------------------------\nWebsite: http://52Kards.com\nInstagram: http://Instagram.com/52Kards\nFacebook: http://on.fb.me/52Kards\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/52Kards',

        "The New Website! - https://Mint52.com\n\nI've been slowly getting back into the rhythm of creating content, and I'm excited to share a new video with you! Since this is the first video I've released in a while, I wanted to teach an extra special card effect... The Dream of Aces card trick (also known as Mcdonalds Aces).\n\nThe aces magically vanish one at a time, and then reappear moments later next to the leader ace (the ace of spades). This is a classic plot in magic and so many different magicians have worked on it throughout the years. Even David Copperfield performed a version of this on national television; and for a very good reason.\n\n▼ Cards Used \n-----------------------------------\nMint Gaff Pack - https://mint52.com/collections/accessories/products/gaff-pack\nCucumber Mint (2nd Edition) - https://mint52.com/collections/playing-cards/products/cucumber-mint\n\n▼ Reference Videos\n-----------------------------------\nElmsley Count tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Btz2gYnu3fc\nBeginner Double Lift tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gjd4EDm3EWU\nAdvanced Double Lift tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl0rM4qpxWo\n\n▼ Credits/Sources\n-----------------------------------\nMac McDonald\n\nSources include:\nMichael Ammar\nJohn Mendoza\nJohn Guastaferro\nMartin Nash\n\n▼ Follow 52Kards Everywhere\n------------------------------------------\nWebsite: http://52Kards.com\nInstagram: http://Instagram.com/52Kards\n\nMusic - Scribbled Notes by Johannes Bornlof",

        "The Mint 2 decks are now ready at https://Mint52.com\n\nThe Coin Matrix is literally one of my favorite magic tricks ever. It's incredibly strong, visual, and practical. Everything I look for in a magic effect! This is quite a simple version of the trick but it's one of the best in my opinion. It doesn't require any prior preparation and can be performed without any gimmicks or special coins. Please do practice this a good amount before sharing it with anyone. The \"moves\" needed to perform this trick aren't all that complicated at all, but it's important to practice enough to get all of the movements to be smooth and with a good rhythm. Hope you enjoy!\n\nSubscribe to the 52Kards Email List: https://52kards.com/subscribe\nPurchase a Close up Pad: https://shop.52kards.com/collections/card-mats\n\nCredits/Sources\n-----------------------------------\nThe Coin Matrix and the pick-up move is credited to Al Schneider.\n\nSong is \"Sapphire\" by Tobu.",

Any likenesses or similarities with the work or creations of other magicians, creators or artists are purely coincidental.  When likeminded artists with similar ambitions attempt to achieve all of the wonderful and amazing things that are possible with a deck of playing cards, obviously similarities will occur and similar problem-solving individuals, will inevitably reach the same conclusions and arrive at the same destinations.  It then becomes a matter of ‘who came first?’  The chicken, it was the chicken.\nBefore sharing or publishing my creations and discoveries, I often call upon a few close people who help me research so that if any similarities ever occur, I can correctly acknowledge, credit or remove where appropriate.  Should my work, creations or publications share any likenesses that are not acknowledged or credited correctly, there is usually a justified reason, however, I do aim to credit and acknowledge correctly and accordingly so please, let me know if you believe that I have missed or not acknowledged when and where I should have…  I am always learning and in my plight to advance the practice and performance of magic as an art, I will always do the right thing and offer fanx, credit and acknowledgments.\nD@MADISON.cards",

        "SUBSCRIBE: http://MADISON.yt/SUBSCRIBE\n\nTo follow on from, and to compliment my last video - DIAMONDS, here is an idea with PERFECT ACES, which I mentioned in the last video.  This trick allows you to apparently predict the positions of any number of cards in a deck thoroughly shuffled by the participant - and you can use this same method to also know the exact positions of all of the Aces in a shuffled deck.  Also, the deck give-away winner is announced in this video!  Enjoy! x\n\nMy last video - DIAMONDS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-LfSSLDPw4\n\nJoin the MALLIANCE: http://MADISON.ist\n\nMAD Merch : http://MADISON.yt/MERCH\nMy MASTERCLASS Lessons: http://MADISON.yt/MASTERCLASS\n\nSend me decks to feature on my channel…\nMADISON / ELECTRIC PICTURE HOUSE TATTOOS.\n32 TOWN STREET.
